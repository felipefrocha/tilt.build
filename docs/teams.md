Many Tilt Cloud features will be based on the concept of a Tilt team. Once you've signed in to Tilt Cloud, create a team by selecting the option at the top right, entering a team name, and clicking Create My Team. This will bring you to the team page of your new team. You are the team owner as a result. To navigate to an existing team that you own, hover over the Teams dropdown at the top right of the screen.

You can also change the team name on this page.

Currently, the team page shows the last [Last Seen Versions](/last_seen_versions.html) of Tilt for team members. Team membership is defined in [Last Seen Versions](/last_seen_versions.html) too.

A team page is only accessible by the team owner.
